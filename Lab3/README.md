## OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this lab is to familiarize you with the process of creating and importing a custom
IP module for a Zynq Processing System based system. We will be using the ‘Create and Package IP’ in
Vivado to develop a custom peripheral for performing integer multiplication. We will then integrate the
integer multiplication peripheral into a microprocessor system and develop software to interact with the
peripheral using the SDK. This lab serves as a simple hardware/software co-design example.
