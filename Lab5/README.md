## OBJECTIVE
The objective of this week’s lab is to cross compile a simple ‘Hello World!” kernel module on the the ECE
server workstations, and load the module into the Linux kernel on the ZYBO Z7-10 board.
You will then create a kernel module, which prints messages to the kernel’s message buffer. However,
this kernel module will also moderate kernel access to the multiplication peripheral created in Lab 3.
