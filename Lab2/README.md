## Objective

The purpose of lab this week is to familiarize you with Vivado by developing a software based solution for
controlling the LEDs in a manner similar to that which was done last lab in pure FPGA hardware. To
accomplish this goal, you will be guided through the process of creating a MicroBlaze processor system
using the Vivado Block Design Builder. You will then add General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) capabilities 
to the microprocessor via Intellectual Property (IP) hardware blocks from Xilinx. Finally, you will
create software using the C programming language, which will run on the MicroBlaze processor in order to
implement the appropriate LED functionality.
