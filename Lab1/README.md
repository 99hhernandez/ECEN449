## Objective

The aim of this weekâ€™s lab exercise is to familarize you with the Xilinx FPGA design flow via Vivado by
stepping through a simple example. We will use Vivado to create hardware, which lights up the LEDs on
the ZYBO Z7-10 board depending on the status of the on-board DIP switches. The hardware will be using
an FPGA and designed in Vivado using Verilog. After completing the aforementioned example, you will be
expected to implement a simple counter and jackpot game on your own with the knowledge gained from the
first part of this lab.
